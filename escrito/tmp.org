When one factor is present in both periods, the cross-temporal effect cancels out, leaviong the mean outcome as if absent in both periods. 

An alternative specification adds coefficients to capture heterogeneity between a factor present/absent in both periods. This is a cross-sectional-only approach adds a dummy $T$ equal 1 for $t=2$:

$$y = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 x + \alpha_2 z + \alpha_3 T + \alpha_4 xz + \alpha_5 xT + \alpha_6 zT + \alpha_7 xzT + \epsilon$$.
