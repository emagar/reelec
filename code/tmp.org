*Tip:* Once you do a search using search operators, you can use the results to set up a filter for these messages.

*Note:* When using numbers as part of your query, a space or a dash (-) will separate a number while a dot (.) will be a decimal. For example, 01.2047-100 is considered 2 numbers: 01.2047 and 100.
