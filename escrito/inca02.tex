\section{Introduction}

\noindent En route

\section{Reform, consequences}

2014 reform surprising removal of term limits. Adopted in 1934, cornerstone of partisan centralization of power under the PRI. Removed immediate reelection at all levels.

PAN placed removal among its requests, as was standard. Unlike the past, when left and PRI would veto, it was adopted along other changes.

Federal deputies can reelect for up to four consecutive three-year terms, senators for two consecutive six-year terms. Fearing that members of Congress might gain too much independence from party leaders, reformers retained some control: incumbents must be renominated by the same party in whose ticket they originally ran. Elaborate. 

Kick-off in the 2021 mid-term election.

At subnational level, reformers left some discretion to state legislatures. State law-makers: either 2-, 3-, or 4-term limits. For municipal officers single- or 2-term limits. Two states only retained single-term limits for municipal presidents, Hidalgo and Veracruz. Unelected municipal officers in Oaxaca's \emph{usos y costumbres} Party clause mandatory. Variable election calendars: incumbents on the ballot progressively. 

Figure \ref{F:horizons} reports relative frequencies of incumbents with shifting electoral horizons since the reform. Each vertical bar accounts for all municipalities with elected officeholders---a handful of new municipalities were carved out in the period, so column totals vary between 2,016 and 2,039. Gray segments include municipalities in Hidalgo and Veracruz, states that retained single term limits, as municipalities nationwide did before 2014. Non-reformers account for nearly 15 percent of yearly observations. The first batch of returning incumbents arrived in 2018, in darker green segments. A total of 273 municipal presidents from 17 states secured reelection for a consecutive term that year, 12 more joining them in 2019. Together these account for 14 percent of observed municipalities, or almost 20 percent when population-weighted. The inaugural proportion is remarkable, the 2018 races concurred with a presidential race won by a landslide that, we will see, probably depressed reelection rates. 

Two other patterns stand out. Term-limited municipal officers, in light green, have decreased gradually but steadily---from about 35 percent in 2015 to less than 5 percent in 2018. Unlike the gray segments, these incumbents remain ineligible for consecutive reelection due to reforms coming into force further down in time. 

Freshmen elected in 2015, representing nearly 50 percent of municipal officers, had a very different perspective from their predecessors, as they were not barred from running again at the end of the term.  

Other post-2014 incumbents, in light purple, remained term-limited due to reforms coming into force further down in time. This block shrank progressively from about one-third of municipalities in 2015 to less than 5 percent in 2018. By 2021, only returning incumbents will be term limited.

Members of Congress can be reelected for up to 12 consecutive years. With 3-year terms, 

Term limits sever the personalized electoral connection, collective reputation only without the personal element.

See \citet{cain.etal.1987} for argumentation.

\section{A hypothesis perhaps}

\begin{description}
  \item [Hypothesis 1:] Presidents are more likely to fast-track bills when the committee chair with jurisdiction over the bill  belongs to the president's party than otherwise.
